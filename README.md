## Core Features ✨

This template includes a suite of powerful tools to streamline your development workflow:

- **Git Hooks with Husky 🐶:** Automatically run checks before you commit.
  - `pre-commit`: Lints your code to catch errors early.
  - `commit-msg`: Enforces conventional commit messages.
- **Conventional Commits with Commitlint ✅:** Ensures your commit history is clean, readable, and semantic.
- **Automated Releases with Release Please 🚀:** Automatically generates changelogs and creates GitHub releases based on your commit history.
- **CI/CD Workflows 🤖:** A set of useful GitHub Actions to automate your workflow:
  - `lint.yml`: Lints your codebase on every push and pull request.
  - `test.yml`: Runs your test suite.
  - `release-please.yml`: Manages your release process.
  - `semantic-pr.yml`: Checks that your pull request titles follow the conventional commit format.

## Future Enhancements 🔮

We have a few ideas for future enhancements. Feel free to contribute or suggest new ones!

- **Testing Framework:**
  - [ ] Integrate a testing framework like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) to enable unit and integration testing.
- **TypeScript Support:**
  - [ ] Add support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to improve code quality and maintainability.
- **Docker Integration:**
  - [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` to allow for containerized development and deployment.
- **Environment Variables:**
  - [ ] Add support for managing environment variables with a library like [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).
- **Logging:**
  - [ ] Integrate a structured logger like [Winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) or [Pino](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pino).
- **Development Workflow:**
  - [ ] Add `nodemon` to automatically restart the server on file changes during development.
- **CI/CD Enhancements:**
  - [ ] Add a security vulnerability scan (e.g., `npm audit`) to the CI pipeline.
  - [ ] Generate and report code coverage statistics.
